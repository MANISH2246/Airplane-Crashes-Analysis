## Overview

This repository focuses on the analysis of airplane crashes using a comprehensive dataset. The dataset encompasses a wide range of information related to aviation incidents, including details about crashes, fatalities, aircraft types, operators, and other pertinent aspects.

## Motivation

Understanding trends and patterns in airplane crashes is crucial for improving aviation safety. This analysis aims to provide insights into various factors contributing to crashes, thereby assisting in the development of preventive measures.

## Analysis Queries

A set of SQL queries has been meticulously crafted to perform diverse analyses on the dataset. These queries cover critical aspects such as fatalities over time, common aircraft manufacturers, distribution of fatalities by aircraft type, ground incidents, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset employed for this analysis is available in the `data` directory. It is structured with a defined schema, offering transparency into the variables and their meanings.

## Usage

The SQL queries provided can be utilized or adapted for further analysis or research purposes. Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are highly encouraged. If you have insights or enhancements to share, please feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.
